## Installation

```
npm install --save navahq/hcgov-pattern-library
```

The pattern library is now installed as a dependency. You can use the un-compiled files found in the `src/` directory or the compiled files in the `dist/` directory.

_Note: Eventually the package will be published to NPM, but for now you'll need to reference the package by its repo, like above._
