title: Exposed within
status: alpha
usage: |
  The "Exposed within" pattern is a way to progressively disclose additional content when an option (radio or checkbox) is selected. The additional content is visually nested within the selected option, hence the name.
react-example: core/src/components/ChoiceList/ExposedWithin
---

## Guidance
- Limit to one level of nesting
- Limit to nesting 1â€“3 inputs that aren't overly information dense
- Exposing within radio button options is suggested. Exposing within checkboxes is also okay when there's only one follow-up question for each checkbox.
