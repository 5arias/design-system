/*
Base

The design system tries to avoid applying global styling using element-specific selectors, since this can make it difficult to include it selectively in an existing codebase. However, there are just a few base global styles that we apply to make the initial setup easier.

If you'd prefer not to have these styles applied, don't import the `base/index.scss` layer.
