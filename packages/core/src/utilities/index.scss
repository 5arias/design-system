Utilities

Utility class names follow the format: `ds-u-[NAME]`

A utility class modifies a single trait. To apply a trait, or a combination of traits to an element, add the corresponding class directly to the HTML element.

Together, they can form a variety of UI patterns. You won't always want to use combinations of utilities to generate more complicated patterns, but the option is there. Once you've identified a set of traits that seem to be reused a lot, it's a good time to consider turning those into a component.
