> A static documentation site for the design system

## Installation

The documentation site piggybacks on the design system's build process, but it also has its own set of dependencies. The initial installation requires a bit of jumping back and forth between the main project directory and this `docs/` subdirectory.

#### Install dependencies

1. First, setup the main project's dependencies by following the [`CONTRIBUTING` directions](https://github.com/CMSgov/design-system/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
2. Then, `cd docs` and run `yarn install`

#### Generating documentation

To view the documentation locally, run `yarn start` from the project root.
